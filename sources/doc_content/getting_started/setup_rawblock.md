##RawBlock Web Starterkit
It is often a hard and time consuming part to start a new project. To help you with this, we developed the **RawBlock Web Starterkit**. Which gives you a solid base with a selection of tools to help you with this process.

###One Time Setup Requirements
RawBlock Web Starterkit relies on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). These tools must be globally installed on your machine.
Node and NMP are used to run [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), the task runner. NPM will download the modules needed to perform certain tasks in Grunt.
