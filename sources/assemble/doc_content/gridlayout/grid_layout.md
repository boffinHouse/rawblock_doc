#Basic principles

The Flexible box layout mode, or flexbox, introduces some very interesting features that we've used in Ink. Most of them are relative to the grid system but as you probably know, or will find out, that means they affect many other components in the framework.

These new features include:

- Control over an elements vertical and horizontal alignment.
- Control over the content vertical and horizontal alignment.
- Reordering elements in your layouts independently of their order in the markup.
- Reversing element flow, i.e. back to front and bottom to top.
- Automatic width distribution i.e. grids without having to declare widths.
- On this page we'll cover all the places where flexbox feature enhancement exists and how to take advantage of them.

Be aware that the Flexible box layout mode is still at the Candidate Recommendation stage of the specification and even though the W3C encourages browser makers to implement it, it is subject to change before the final version of the specification.
