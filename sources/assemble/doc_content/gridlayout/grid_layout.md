##Basic principles
The structure of the layout is defined by the use of modifier classes. Modifiers in RawBlock are flags set on block or elements to represent a different state or version and are are recognizable by the `.is-*` prefix . The layout modifiers are globally defined and can be used on all elements of the page.
